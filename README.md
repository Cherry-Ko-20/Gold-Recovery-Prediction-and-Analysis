## Introduction

The mining industry often involves complex processes for extracting valuable metals like gold. Predictive models can assist in optimizing these processes and improving overall efficiency. This project explores the use of machine learning techniques, specifically regression models, to predict gold recovery metrics.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing various features related to the gold recovery process. The dataset includes information about input feed, concentrations of metals at different stages, and target variables such as rougher and final gold recovery. The data exploration and preprocessing steps are detailed in the [main.py](main.py) script.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **main.py**: The main script that includes data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **files/**: Directory containing the input data files.
- **README.md**: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage 
>The main.py script covers the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Adjust parameters, models, or features as needed for further experimentation.

## Results

This project focused on the analysis and optimization of the gold recovery process in a mining operation.
The best model was selected based on performance in cross-validation and tested using the test dataset.
In our case, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated superior performance compared to the Linear Regressor. The lower sMAPE mean values obtained from the Random Forest model indicate its potential to deliver better predictions for the mining organization's gold recovery process. This suggests that the Random Forest model is a reliable choice for optimizing the gold recovery process in the mining operation.
