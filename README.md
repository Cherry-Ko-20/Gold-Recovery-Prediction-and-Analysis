## Introduction

The mining industry often involves complex processes for extracting valuable metals like gold. Predictive models can assist in optimizing these processes and improving overall efficiency. This project explores the use of machine learning techniques, specifically regression models, to predict gold recovery metrics.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing various features related to the gold recovery process. The dataset includes information about input feed, concentrations of metals at different stages, and target variables such as rougher and final gold recovery. The data exploration and preprocessing steps are detailed in the [main.py](main.py) script.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **main.py**: The main script that includes data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **files/**: Directory containing the input data files.
- **README.md**: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.
